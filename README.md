Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a sudden onset of kidney failure/damage marked by an increase in the creatinine levels (amongst other biomarkers) of the patient . AKI Tomorrow is a pilot study which attempts to predict which patients will develop AKI in the next 24 hours. For each patient, a risk-score is generated of their likelyhood of developing AKI; if the patient is above  a certain risk-score they will be alerted.

This contains the code to verify the risk scores of each patient in a given dataset (N = 2850) based on a Logistic Regression model with 12 variables. It is written in a google colab notebook, in Python, and all the patient information is stripped for patient confidentiality/HIPAA compliance purposes.
